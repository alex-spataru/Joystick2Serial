/**
 * @brief The HAL_Driver class
 *
 * Abstract class that defines common I/O and data access functions for different types of
 * devices. I/O drivers (e.g. serial port & network) are sub-classes of this class.
 *
 * This allows the rest of the I/O module to interact with a wide range of devices and
 * protocols without the need of understanding protocol-specific implementation details.
